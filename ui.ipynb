      "[{'text': 'Are you a list maker? Like do you wake up in the morning and make lists and cross things off and then decide what are the key items on that list? No, I\\'m a time blocker. Time blocker, okay. Yeah. Yeah, so I\\'m not a big believer in to-do list, I like to grapple with the actual available time. Like, okay, I have a meeting here, I have to like pick my kids up from school here. Here\\'s the actual hours of the day that are free and where they fall. All right, what do I want to do with that time? Well, okay, now that I see that there\\'s a lot of gaps in the middle of the day here, they\\'re short, maybe there I\\'m going to do a lot of small non-cognitively demanding thing. Oh, this first 90 minutes in the morning is like the main time I have uninterrupted. Okay, so this, I\\'m going to work on writing. So I\\'ve been a big believer of this since I was an undergrad. Like you give your time a job as opposed to having a list, which is somewhat orthogonal to what\\'s actually happening in your day. And then just as you go through your day saying, \"What do I want to try to do next?\" Which I think is a lot less efficient. I\\'m going to try your method. I try and structure my days as much as I can but it just never quite works. Do you work late into the night or you, no? No, I\\'m a 5:30 man. Okay. Yeah. So 5:30 p.m., that\\'s it? Yeah, more or less, that\\'s my cutoff. Now one exception is if I\\'m writing on deadline, I\\'ll sometimes, like if I need to get more writing done, I can do an evening writing session which I got used to through long experience of, I used to write my blog post at night after like my kids went to bed. Now they\\'re older and they don\\'t go to bed as early. So it\\'s like the one thing I have left that I\\'ll do after 5:30 is like every once in a while I\\'ll do like a 90-minute evening writing block. But I call this, by the way, this whole philosophy, I call fixed schedule productivity. And I\\'ve been doing it since I was a grad student, fix the work hour schedule, that\\'s my commitment. I work in these hours and then work downstream from that for everything else. So like this controls like even what you decide to bring into your life \\'cause you know I can\\'t go past the schedule and it drives you to be more innovative in how you deal with your time and schedule. You have to be efficient because you only have these hours here. That\\'s been a signal for my life since I was in my early 20s. Fix the schedule and don\\'t work outside of that schedule. Now it\\'s your move to figure out, anything you want to do, you have to make that work. You want to become a professor, figure out how to make that work. You want to write books while you\\'re being a professor, figure out how to make that work. You don\\'t have the option of just throwing hours at it. And you innovate a lot I think when you have the constraints. Where do sleep and exercise fit into your schedule? What\\'s your typical to bedtime, wake up time, what\\'s your typical exercise routine? And the reason I ask about this is because I think nowadays we hopefully people understand that exercise and cognitive function are inextricably linked. Yeah. And we\\'re all going to live longer lives and be sharper mentally by doing exercise. Yeah, so, I mean, my main like actual working with weights, I do this pre-dinner, right. And this was an innovation of the last couple of years, it\\'s a fantastic psychologically for me. This is a transition from work to like family time after work. So I\\'ll do like 45, 50 minutes garage gym that we built during COVID after I\\'m done working before dinner. And once you get used to that like it also forces you like, I got to finish work \\'cause I got to get this in before dinner. But then I\\'ll do also quite a bit of walking if it\\'s not a teaching day so I\\'m not on campus. I do a lot of thinking on foot, walking my kids to the bus stop which isn\\'t particularly close and back. So I\\'ll do a lot of walking. But my serious exercise now is always pre-dinner. Then I want to be up in our room by 10. And then at that point I don\\'t track, so I have insomnia issues, which actually has been like key driver of a lot of the things I think about, especially with slow productivity, is I\\'m very wary because I can without any control on my own, just find myself unable to sleep sometimes. Fall asleep or stay asleep? Fall asleep, yeah. I mean, I used to get it really bad. Not so bad now but you know, it comes and goes. That really affected the way I thought about productivity because it seemed like to me the definition of just I get after it with a bunch of stuff wasn\\'t really on the table because if my notion of productivity depended on me like every day being able to just like hammer on a bunch of stuff. I\\'m very busy, I have lots of commitments. What would happen if I couldn\\'t sleep? I wouldn\\'t be able to do that so I drifted naturally towards a definition of productivity which was, it doesn\\'t really matter if you work tomorrow but it is important that like this month you work like writing a book. It doesn\\'t matter if you work on your book chapter tomorrow in particular, but like this month you have to spend a lot of time working on it. So it was like an insomnia-compatible definition of productivity was sort of morphed into this idea of slow productivity, taking your time with it. So it\\'s interesting. So like sleep issues really shaped the way I thought about work and put me on these much longer timescales of productivity. Try not to be dependent on any particular day being critical to what you do. I don\\'t want the high stress situation. I don\\'t want the like I\\'m just going to, 10 hours a day for the next 10 days, we\\'re going to make this deal happen. Like I can\\'t operate in that space \\'cause I worry about it, anytime my brain could betray me and I could like lose sleep for a couple days. I think it\\'s really important that you\\'re sharing this because while people\\'s challenges differ, I think oftentimes people hear the content of my podcast or other podcasts and think, \"Oh, gosh, I have to have everything dialed in just right.\" When in fact, most all of the tools and protocols that have been discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast are in response to a particular challenge that I\\'ve had or that others close to me have had. And I love this. Well, I\\'m sorry that you suffer from insomnia, we have a series on sleep with Matt Walker in which he lays out some great tools that we haven\\'t yet discussed on the podcast. I\\'ll just send you, I\\'ll text you, I\\'ll call you with a short list of those and hopefully they\\'ll help as we do cover insomnia in some depth. But I think it\\'s important that people realize that they can be very productive with the hours that they have and the moments or hours of high focus clarity that they have even if they\\'re not sleeping great, even if they\\'re raising small children because that\\'s the real world and certainly that\\'s the real world of deadlines and academia but family and colds and flus and travel and jet lag and arguments and all the happy stuff too. Vacations, so sounds like you\\'re very good at adapting your day to what\\'s going on around it but that you have certain sort of committed time. Am I correct in assuming that you have at least one period of say, 60 to 90 minutes of real, what you would call deep work, let\\'s say at least five days a week? I know that might be an underestimate but it seems like that\\'s what- That the goal. That\\'s what I\\'m extracting from this. That\\'s the goal, right? So to me, depending on the season, is how extreme that can get. So the busiest season would be like a teaching semester, right? But even then I\\'m going to make sure that five days a week I\\'m starting with deep work and the non-teaching days are more than the teaching days. Compare that to the summer, for example, where like, all I do for the most part is deep work. No meetings on Mondays and Fridays, all admin stuff is midday to early afternoon, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Everything else is deep work, you know? Just locked in, hours at a time. But I want, if I\\'m not getting five days, five days of starting the day with deep work, I\\'m unhappy, right? Because I mean, I keep coming back to this is okay because I\\'m not going to be able to, I mean, fortunately, the insomnia hasn\\'t bothered me in years but the threat of it like completely shaped the way I think about things and because I know I\\'m never going to be, have a sort of like an Elon Musk style energy of like, I can just take on seven companies and make it happen, right? I just don\\'t have that ability. I\\'ve always focused on the long game and to me the long game plays out with get your deep work time in, you know? Just keep working on the stuff you do best and get better at it, you know? Tomorrow doesn\\'t matter. But if you\\'re doing this most days for the next four months, like that\\'s going to matter, you know? And so I often think about productivity in my own life at the scale of decades. Like what do I want to do in my 20s, you know? Okay, what do I want to do in my 30s? You know, what do I want to do in my 40s? And that helps. Like in my 30s, I had a lot of young kids like it\\'s, yeah, I mean, the amount of time I could spend total working is like much less, right? But I could still think about what do I want to do in my 30s? How do I make that happen? Let me make sure I\\'m pushing like on those things. Then everything else I can adapt to, I can give here and there, you know? It allows you to be very adaptable when you\\'re thinking about what do I want to do for the next 10 years. It also means you\\'re not on a random Tuesday chiding yourself because like, why didn\\'t I get three more hours of work in? And that becomes sort of a nonsensical question. And what you care about is like what happens in the next decade, which is, that\\'s the long game. It\\'s not about hustling today. It\\'s about, I came back to deep work day after day after day when other people got distracted by TikTok. Like I got to, yeah, whatever, it\\'s that coming back to what matters again and again.

      "[{'text': \"are you a list maker like do you wake up  in the morning and make lists and cross  things off and then decide what are the  key items on that list no I'm a Time  blocker time blocker yeah yeah so I'm  not a big believer in to-do list I like  to Grapple with the actual available  time like okay I have a meeting here I  have to like pick my kids up from school  here here's the actual hours of the day  that are free and where they fall all  right what do I want to do at that time  well okay now that I see that there's a  lot of gaps in the middle of the day  here they're short maybe there I'm going  to do lot of small non-c conly demanding  thing oh this first 90 minutes in the  morning is like the main time I have  uninterrupted okay so this I'm going to  work on writing so i' I've been a big  believer of this since I was an  undergrad like you give your time a job  as opposed to having a list which is  somewhat orthogonal to what's actually  happening in your day and then just as  you go through your day saying what do I  want to try to do next which I think is  a lot less  efficient I'm going to try your method  um I try and structure my days as much  as I can but it just never quite Works  um do work late into the night or you no  no I'm I'm a 5:30 man okay yeah so 5:30  p.m. that's it yeah more or less that's  my cut off now the the one exception is  um if I'm writing on Deadline I'll  sometimes like if I need to get more  writing done I can do uh an evening  writing session which which I got used  to through long experience of I used to  write my blog post at night after like  my kids went to bed now they're older  and they don't go to bed as early so  it's like the one thing I have left that  I'll do after 5:30 is like every once in  a while I'll do like a 90 minute evening  writing block um but I call this by the  way this whole philosophy I call fix  schedule productivity and I've been  doing it since I was a grad student fix  the work hour schedule that's my  commitment I work in these hours um and  then work Downstream from that for  everything else so like this controls  like even what you decide to bring into  your life because you know I can't go  past a schedule um and it drives you to  be more Innovative and how you deal with  your time and schedule you have to be  efficient because you only have these  these hours here uh that's been you know  a signal for my my since I was in my  early 20s fix the schedule and don't  work outside of that schedule now it's  your move to figure out anything you  want to do you have to make that work  you want to become a professor figure  out how to make that work you want to  write books while you're being a  professor figure out how to make that  work you don't have the option of just  throwing hours at it and you innovate a  lot I think when you have the  constraints where do sleep and exercise  fit into your schedule uh what's your  typical to bed time wakeup time what's  your um typical exercise routine and the  reason I ask about this is because I  think nowadays we hopefully people  understand that exercise and cognitive  function are are inextricably linked  yeah and we're all going to live longer  lives and be sharper mentally by doing  exercise yeah so I mean my main like  actual working with weights I do this  predinner right and this was an  innovation the last couple of years it's  it's a fantastic psychologically for me  this is a transition from work to like  family time after work so so I'll do  like 45 50 minutes uh garage God's gym  you know that we built during Co after  I'm done working before dinner and once  you get used to that like it also forces  you to like I got to finish work because  I got to get this in before dinner but  then I'll do also quite a bit of walking  if it's not a teaching day so I'm not on  campus uh I do a lot of thinking on foot  um you know walking my kids to the bus  stop which isn't particularly close in  back so I'll do a lot of walking but  that's when I my serious exercise now is  always always pre- dinner then uh I want  to be up you know in our room by 10:  yeah and then at that point I don't  track so I have insomnia issues which  which actually has been like key driver  of a lot of the things I think about  especially with slow productivity is I'm  very wary because I can without any  control on my own just find myself  unable to sleep sometimes fall asleep or  stay asleep fall asleep yeah I mean I  used to get it really bad um not so bad  now but you know it comes and goes that  really affected the way I thought about  productivity because it seemed like to  me the the definition of just I get  after it with a bunch of stuff  wasn't really on the table because if my  notion of productivity depended on me  like every day being able to just like  hammer on a bunch of stuff I'm very busy  I have lots of commitments what would  happen if I couldn't sleep I wouldn't be  able to do that so it I drifted  naturally towards a definition of  productivity which was it doesn't really  matter if you work tomorrow but it is  important that like this month you work  like writing a book it doesn't matter if  you work on your book chapter tomorrow  in particular but like this month you  have to spend a lot of time working on  it so it was uh like an insomnia  compatible definition of productivity  was sort of morphed into this idea of  slow productivity taking your your time  with it so it's interesting so like  sleep issues really shaped the way I  thought about work and put me on these  much longer time scales of productivity  try not to be dependent on any  particular day being critical to what  you do I don't want the high stress  situation I don't want the like I'm just  going to 10 hours a day for the next 10  days we're going to make this deal  happen like I can't operate in that  space because I worry about it anytime  my brain could betray me and I could  like lose sleep for a couple days I  think it's really important that you're  sharing this because while people's  challenges differ I think often times  people hear the content of my podcast or  other podcasts and think oh gosh I have  to have everything dialed in just right  when in fact most all of the tools and  protocols that have been discussed on  the huberman Lab podcast are in response  to a particular challenge that I've had  um or that others close to me have had  um and I I love this well I I'm sorry  that you suffer from insomnia U we have  a series uh on sleep with Matt Walker in  which he lays out some some great tools  that we haven't yet discussed on the  podcast I'll just um send you I'll text  you I'll call you with with a short list  of those and hopefully they'll help but  as we do cover insomnia in some depth  but but I think it's important that  people realize that they can be very  productive with the hours that they have  and the the moments or hours of of high  focus Clarity that they have um even if  they're not sleeping great even if  they're raising small children um  because that's the real world and  certainly that's the real world of  deadlines and Academia but um family and  um colds and flu and travel and jet lag  and arguments and all the happy stuff  too Vacations so um sounds like you're  very good at adapting your day to what's  going on around it but that you have  certain sort of committed time um am I  correct in assuming that you have at  least one period of say  60 to 90 minutes of real what you would  call Deep work uh let's say at least 5  days a week I know that might be an  underestimate but seems like that's what  what I'm that's what I'm extracting from  this that's the goal right so so to me  uh depending on the season is how  extreme that I can get so the the  busiest season would be like a teaching  semester right but even then I'm going  to make sure that five days a week I'm  starting with deep work and the  non-teaching days are more than the  teaching days compare that to the summer  for example where like all I do for the  most part is deep work no meetings on  Mondays and Fridays all admin stuff is  uh midday to early afternoon Tuesday  Wednesday Thursday um everything else is  deep work you know just locked in you  hours at a time but I want if I'm not  getting five days five days of starting  the day with deep work I'm I'm unhappy  right because I mean I keep coming back  to this is okay because I'm not going to  be able to I mean fortunately the  insomnia doesn't bother hasn't bothered  me in years but the the the threat of it  like completely shaped the way I I think  about things and because I know I'm  never going to be uh have a sort of like  an Elon mus style energy of like I can  just take on seven companies and make it  happen right I just don't have that  ability um I've always focused on the  long game and to me the long game plays  out with get your deep work time in you  know just keep working on the stuff you  do best and get better at it you know  tomorrow doesn't matter but if you if  you're doing this most days for the next  four months like that's going to matter  you know and so I often think about  productivity in my own life at the scale  of decades what do I want to do in my 20  you know okay what do I want to do in my  30s you know what do I want to do in my  40s you know U and that helps like in my  30s I had a lot of young kids like it's  yeah I mean the amount of time I could  spend total working is like much less  right but I could still think about what  do I want to do in my 30s how do I make  that happen let me make sure I'm pushing  like on those things then everything  else I can adapt to I can give here and  there you know it allows you to be very  adaptable when you're thinking about  what do I want to do you know for the  next 10 years it also means you're not  on a random Tuesday try yourself because  like why didn't I get three more hours  of working that becomes sort of a  nonsensical question when what you care  about is like what happens in the next  decade which is that's the long game  it's not about you know hustling today  it's about I came back to deep Ork day  after day after day when other people  got distracted by Tik Tok you know like  I'm GNA you whatever it's that

       "\"hello everyone welcome to AI anytime channel in this video we are going to see how we can use a no code platform called def aai with ol Lama earlier I have a video where I've shown how you can use Dy AI you know and geni Innovation engine a completely you know a low code no code platform where you can build jna applications faster and in that video I have shown with close Source models where you need an API key now for example if you want to use models like gp40 om mini you know Cloud models Gemini models Gro models so on and so forth so you need an API key over there to use that but you know most of the time you would not use these apis you want to use something which is open source where you can self host it you know where you can control everything you know mainly from a data confidentiality standpoint right because your data is confidential and you would not like to send that data to a third party company for example here the llm providers so how we can use o Lama a tool that basically helps you inference or run large language models locally in your machine you will be follow you'll be able to follow this video even on a 8GB CPU machine as well okay so we're going to set up Dy and we're going to also use AMA uh any of the new models like Lama 3.2 3B model okay and we're going to use it and see if we are able to set this up and ask some queries or do some task for us so let's jump in and see how we can do that if you look at here on my screen I am on AMA website if you don't know AMA as I said get up and running with llms that's what they have written over here on the website and you can just download I know it's like pretty easy to work with Okay you can download this on any one of the operating system so if you are on Mac OS if you are on Linux of you are on Windows you'll be able to use that okay now I am already on Windows and I have already installed it so I'm not going to do it again but if you are here click on this and just double click and install how can you find out if o Lama is running you see this icon over here it says o Lama right o Lama is running okay now if you want to find out a bit more let me open my terminal okay so if you look at here I'm opening my terminal and you can use command like o Lama list to find out if there are any models available you can see I have lot of models available Lama 3.2 3B Elijah which is a Japanese model it be nomic embedding I have an embedding model Lama 3.1 53 and Lama 3 I have these models that I mainly work with in day-to-day life you know for different tasks that I execute through these llms now how you can use this you have to for example you just have to write o Lama and then run and the model name if you want to download a model you have to do o Lama pull and the model name okay so you use P command to do that now here I'm I going to show you for example Lama 3.2 and 3B and after a few seconds you know it will show you where you can it will say send a message so basically you can ask your query so for example you want to write what is AI or let me say tell me a joke tell me a joke right I say tell me a joke it says here is one what do you call a fake noodle an impasta okay so you can see basically you can just ask a lot of questions over here right now AMA is also available through apis you know you can use uh Local Host and it's available on 11434 you can see it says AMA is running so you can use AMA through Lang chain Lama index or even in basic python through request module if you want to do that you know it's available on Port 11434 right 11,434 that's the port it runs on right now that's on AMA let me cover a bit about dii I have couple of videos on defi already on my channel Innovation engine for engine for Gen applications it's an open source development platform that's why I like about it if you look at other platforms like gum Loof for example or make they are making money for example they are not open source okay so uh nothing against them by the way but I love open source right so uh defy and flow wise flow wise also is very good okay you can use that open source you can basically use uh note to basically install that and build build Solutions on top of it and deploy it but not not the case with gum Loop and make.com or any other platform so defi is one of my Preferred Choice I recommend you use Defi and also flow wise if needed so uh you can see it over here if you click on GitHub it takes you to the GitHub page you know over here it says defi is and open source llm app development platform intuitive interface you can you can basically use dii to build rag pipelines AI agent workflows automation so on and so forth right now Dy you can also you know let me show you how you can bring it up here so if you just have to do get clone and you can see I already have cloned it but anyway I'll just show you once let me show you once so if we're going to write github.com Lang genius I know Dody dogit when I do this it will say this already exist so I already have cloned this repository so if it already exist let's just do CD inside it right so that's what I'm going to do here so I'm going to say you know defy and Docker and I'm just going to open this in vs code so let me just open this in V vs code now if you look at this this is how the doer compos file looks like okay off off this is how the folder looks like when you bring up Dy make sure I miss one this step but I'll show you once you cling it for the first time you will find out something called env. example as GitHub does not it's not a good practice I will not say GitHub does not support pushing EnV files it does it but then the best practice is to do like env. example or through conf Pi or whatever and then replace that when you are working locally or when you are deploying it somewhere in a secret manager or a credentials manager but what you have to do it over here you have to do CP CP means that you want to copy that right the same file to an different file name so you can see I have done cp. env. example and then EnV and that's why these and that's why this is available over here you can see EnV so if you click on EnV you can find out all the EnV thingy and you can whatever if you want to do it here you can bring up so for example if you want to use uh we8 and you can see it over here you can make changes for V8 chroma is here Oracle is here you know engine X is here and you have lot of things over here to be honest you know you have open search uh blah blah blah okay so if you want to work with any service you can select I more interested in Docker compose if you don't know Docker Docker is a container technology I have a lot of videos on Docker I'll recommend you watch that basically you know makes your life easier when you are developing software when you use Docker like a container technology you know it basically eliminate the dependencies conflict from your software development life cycle and there a lot of other benefits by the way okay now this is what we are using as a Docker compose file now what you have to do guys you know here come here you know in in that and then you just have to do dock a compose or you can just up and when you do hyund d hyund d means that it going to run that in a detach mode so in background right so it will not block your terminal for other work and if you do that it's going to take a bit of time you can see it says if you're running it for the first time it's going to take a lot of time because it has to pull a lot of images you know from somewhere like Docker official repository or GitHub registry or AWS registry that they have elastic container registry Azure has Azure container registry gcp has GCR or something right so it basically pulls up from different sources depending on how Dy team has configured it you know in the back end so it's going to pull all of these information and we have to wait for it so let me pause the video and come back once this is done all right now you can see we have you know basically downloaded everything over here so if you see Let Me Go a bit up and you can find out all the containers are now running it says running 11 out of 11 created and running attaching to API 1 d B1 engine X One radi one sandbox one ssrf proxy we database web 1 worker one right now you can build anything you want I'm going to talk about it in a bit but if you look at here all the logs every processes that has been started database is ready you know your everything that you need to basically do it and you just have to do Local Host and apps I already have an account administrative account you know with my personal Gmail address if you're coming into your the first time you need to basically create an administrative account or an admin account to deal with DIY now this is how the interface looks like right you have on top explore Studio knowledge tools here we have something called create from blank create from template and import DSL file now imput import DSL file is nothing but for example if you build a workflow if you build an app on D then you can also save that as a file that's called DSL file and you can later share that with your friends or colleagues and they can use the same basically they don't have to reinvent the wheel they can just you know import that file and execute it right now what I'm going to show you here is here we can have something called settings in the settings you have something called Model provider now in the model provider you can set up your llms so if you want to go with close Source thingy you can go with close Source like like for example open AI anthropic Azure you have to basically give an API key and you can find out we have something called o Lama and we are interested in O Lama because we want to self for it and you can see o Lama is running over here right it says o Lama is running on this particular Port right so what I'm going to do I'm going to bring up o Lama so add a model so let's click on o Lama add model now when you see see this so two things you can do you can either you know add an llm or you can add an text embedding model like nomik that ama supports now in the model name you have to be a bit careful and attentive over here otherwise you get a lot of Errors you know sometimes right so here I have taken a note and I'll just show you okay and you should be a bit careful about only these two things and I'm going to talk about it why are important now in base URL these EVS are nothing but your uh where you are running the O Lama but if you just do HTTP Local Host 11434 it will not work because right now you are hosting it through Docker internals if you look at these how we are running it we running it through Docker right we are not running it in some other ways right so you have to use host. Docker do internal and then the port as a base URL don't do HTTP Local Host 11434 it might not connect it's it will give you some error right and model name you have to be again careful because model name should be the same name that o Lama shows you so for example if you come here and I'm going to show you o Lama list that I already have now if you want to bring up Lama 3.2 3B let me just copy this thingy here okay you have to use the same name okay make sure you using the same name okay as the model name you are not using any like other name names over here other that's what I have seen it otherwise it gives error and then you keep this chat chat is fine this model text is fine upper bound of for Max token these are all fine it's not a Vision support it's a Vision support model of course but I'm going to say no for now okay uh and then be a bit very be a bit attentive over here otherwise this is the thing if you pass this step you know you'll be able to work with it otherwise if you are getting some error then you have to also you can also look at how to integrate with o Lama so if you look at this documentation you can also find out how to do it right now come back and let's save it now once you save it okay you can see modified successfully it here says modified successfully you know on top and now if you come come on top you can see a model so you can see you know if you click on so models we have Lama 3.2 3B llm chat 4K so this is a model now that's showing right and you can see the model is active you can also do some configuration you can add other models as well let me just you know cut this off right now let's click on create from blank once you click on create from blank you can find out different options chatbot text generator agent workflow and if you you know if you look at text generat it says build an application that generates high quality text based on prompt such as generating articles summaries translations and more I'll just give a name here called demo app okay and here going write demo of D5 + oama and I'm just going to click on create now once you click on create right you can see here we have you know and let me just remove this thingy by the way okay if you look at this what you have to do Studio demo app we have here something called left hand side orchestrate API access locks and monitoring now here we can see the model if you look at the model it says Lama 3.2 now if you want to add other model you know you can just go the same way you know over here and you can add it sometimes it might take a bit of time guys you know it takes few seconds because then it has to load it from o Lama right so you should wait for it uh once it's load then you can select that model so you can see it over here Lama uh 3.2 and we can find out the model over here right see Lama 3.2 3B that's the model we have loaded from o Lama now I'm going to ask and here you have prefix prompt you can set some prompt as well over here and you can do bit of prompt engineering blah blah blah you can make the query as an optional parameter I'm going to say what is AI or something okay and then run it says output your speed hanging a but can see work with it but I think this also it is you know if it comes to number of characters it has given you 2,000 plus characters so far you over here you can add annotations edit it and what you can also do you can also publish this app so when you say you know when when you click on publish let me just do an update first published and when you click on run app it opens a new uh uh here demo app you know you can say generate ass sort blog post on deep learning or something like that right and we're going to say execute and you can find go back now and that's that you have to do it in knowledge so if you go on knowledge and over here in the knowledge you can create a knowledge base you can see input from file sync you know you can take a document so for example if you have to take a document you can take a document from here you know let's take uh what document we can take guys gastro no I would have some documents let me see I'll just show you how easy it is to basically work with it right now you come here and then you have to bring up an embedding model but I'll just show you how you can bring a document and those kind of things right so I'm going to use a PDF file over here you can see the PDF I'm going to do next and then you can see the preview automatic set chunk and pre-process you can also customize the chunk size you can see maximum chunk length I'm going to do it th000 and then chunk overlap I'm going to keep it 250 okay and confirm and preview uh I don't know what's wrong but okay let me just do a reset there's something wrong I'm going keep automatic okay it didn't work out then you have index mode high quality you have to pay for it you need to set up a API key you know blah blah let's keep it default go to document you can see this is our document so we have like we have a kind of knowledge Bas you can also test the retrieval please enter text uh list all symptoms or something like that right and when you click on testing it basically gives you something if if that's there it might take a bit of time guys but this is how you can create knowledge basis as well and if you go to Studio okay on let me go to settings once permissions economical blah blah blah trial testing again you have to do it the session is not there okay fine now in in studio come back so this you already see it and this is how you can also embed into your site so basically it gives you a code to embed so basically it gives an if frame that you can use it in an HTML code and you can just basically you know do it you can see install D chatbot Chrome extension chatbot URL and you can see how easy it is to basically install you know chatbot Chrome extension as well right that's that's fantastic over here and uh let me do one thing so this is how you can run applications J applications using Dy and AMA knowledge you see how you have knowledge base now if you go to exp let me go to Studio create from blank if you have a chat B right uh you can just give a name called chatboard demo or something you know uh enter the BL blah blah I'm going say create okay instruction and you can see you can give a context now here in the context you know you can add this as a knowledge base right you can see the knowledge base has been added you have citations and attributes you can add you can bring conversational REM markers like a followup questions you can conversation remaker I mean default questions by the way excuse me you can have a follow-up questions as well you can ask follow-up questions and this all looks nice right now you know here you can uh ask some questions blah blah blah and you can see the model over here and you can select model Lama 3.2 chat and here you can write your prompt words here you know variable whatever right you can say you need to answer the user questions from the you need to ask the user questions from the from the given context and something like that okay and you can add variables as much as as you are as as you want right and then you can just you know publish update publish blah blah blah you can see it success right so this is how it is guys fill the value in variable which will automatically replaced right and you can here ask uh uh yeah sort text right and make it optional as well so this is how you can basically build it uh you can also build rag pipeline or you can run the app see it over here start chat blah blah right now it will not work as expected I'll show you slow guys not passing the context credential is not ah okay I got it so it's not we have to pass that P ke is not taking it but yeah at least you got a bit of idea how you can do it right so you can basically watch my previous videos on how to set up these API keys and I want to keep it a very short maybe we can have a separate video for rag chatbot but so far you would have understood how you can set up D5 with AMA how you can configure you can configure it from here by the way just settings model provider and you can you can also add a new model for example if you want to add a new text embeding model like nomic you can do it over here and then just save it right so you can also use it for rag chatbot that's all for this video guys I hope you liked it if you have any question thoughts or feedbacks let me know in the comment box you can also reach out to me through my social media channels if you

      "[\"hello everyone welcome to AI anytime channel in this video we are going to see how we can use a no code platform called def aai with ol Lama earlier I have a video where I've shown how you can use Dy AI you know and geni Innovation engine a completely you know a low code no code platform where you can build jna applications faster and in that video I have shown with close Source models where you need an API key now for example if you want to use models like gp40 om mini you know Cloud models Gemini models Gro models so on and so forth so you need an API key over there to use that but you know most of the time you would not use these apis you want to use something which is open source where you can self host it you know where you can control everything you know mainly from a data confidentiality standpoint right because your data is confidential and you would not like to send that data to a third party company for example here the llm providers so how we can use o Lama a tool that basically helps you inference or run large language models locally in your machine you will be follow you'll be able to follow this video even on a 8GB CPU machine as well okay so we're going to set up Dy and we're going to also use AMA uh any of the new models like Lama 3.2 3B model okay and we're going to use it and see if we are able to set this up and ask some queries or do some task for us so let's jump in and see how we can do that if you look at here on my screen I am on AMA website if you don't know AMA as I said get up and running with llms that's what they have written over here on the website and you can just download I know it's like pretty easy to work with Okay you can download this on any one of the operating system so if you are on Mac OS if you are on Linux of you are on Windows you'll be able to use that okay now I am already on Windows and I have already installed it so I'm not going to do it again but if you are here click on this and just double click and install how can you find out if o Lama is running you see this icon over here it says o Lama right o Lama is running okay now if you want to find out a bit more let me open my terminal okay so if you look at here I'm opening my terminal and you can use command like o Lama list to find out if there are any models available you can see I have lot of models available Lama 3.2 3B Elijah which is a Japanese model it be nomic embedding I have an embedding model Lama 3.1 53 and Lama 3 I have these models that I mainly work with in day-to-day life you know for different tasks that I execute through these llms now how you can use this you have to for example you just have to write o Lama and then run and the model name if you want to download a model you have to do o Lama pull and the model name okay so you use P command to do that now here I'm I going to show you for example Lama 3.2 and 3B and after a few seconds you know it will show you where you can it will say send a message so basically you can ask your query so for example you want to write what is AI or let me say tell me a joke tell me a joke right I say tell me a joke it says here is one what do you call a fake noodle an impasta okay so you can see basically you can just ask a lot of questions over here right now AMA is also available through apis you know you can use uh Local Host and it's available on 11434 you can see it says AMA is running so you can use AMA through Lang chain Lama index or even in basic python through request module if you want to do that you know it's available on Port 11434 right 11,434 that's the port it runs on right now that's on AMA let me cover a bit about dii I have couple of videos on defi already on my channel Innovation engine for engine for Gen applications it's an open source development platform that's why I like about it if you look at other platforms like gum Loof for example or make they are making money for example they are not open source okay so uh nothing against them by the way but I love open source right so uh defy and flow wise flow wise also is very good okay you can use that open source you can basically use uh note to basically install that and build build Solutions on top of it and deploy it but not not the case with gum Loop and make.com or any other platform so defi is one of my Preferred Choice I recommend you use Defi and also flow wise if needed so uh you can see it over here if you click on GitHub it takes you to the GitHub page you know over here it says defi is and open source llm app development platform intuitive interface you can you can basically use dii to build rag pipelines AI agent workflows automation so on and so forth right now Dy you can also you know let me show you how you can bring it up here so if you just have to do get clone and you can see I already have cloned it but anyway I'll just show you once let me show you once so if we're going to write github.com Lang genius I know Dody dogit when I do this it will say this already exist so I already have cloned this repository so if it already exist let's just do CD inside it right so that's what I'm going to do here so I'm going to say you know defy and Docker and I'm just going to open this in vs code so let me just open this in V vs code now if you look at this this is how the doer compos file looks like okay off off this is how the folder looks like when you bring up Dy make sure I miss one this step but I'll show you once you cling it for the first time you will find out something called env. example as GitHub does not it's not a good practice I will not say GitHub does not support pushing EnV files it does it but then the best practice is to do like env. example or through conf Pi or whatever and then replace that when you are working locally or when you are deploying it somewhere in a secret manager or a credentials manager but what you have to do it over here you have to do CP CP means that you want to copy that right the same file to an different file name so you can see I have done cp. env. example and then EnV and that's why these and that's why this is available over here you can see EnV so if you click on EnV you can find out all the EnV thingy and you can whatever if you want to do it here you can bring up so for example if you want to use uh we8 and you can see it over here you can make changes for V8 chroma is here Oracle is here you know engine X is here and you have lot of things over here to be honest you know you have open search uh blah blah blah okay so if you want to work with any service you can select I more interested in Docker compose if you don't know Docker Docker is a container technology I have a lot of videos on Docker I'll recommend you watch that basically you know makes your life easier when you are developing software when you use Docker like a container technology you know it basically eliminate the dependencies conflict from your software development life cycle and there a lot of other benefits by the way okay now this is what we are using as a Docker compose file now what you have to do guys you know here come here you know in in that and then you just have to do dock a compose or you can just up and when you do hyund d hyund d means that it going to run that in a detach mode so in background right so it will not block your terminal for other work and if you do that it's going to take a bit of time you can see it says if you're running it for the first time it's going to take a lot of time because it has to pull a lot of images you know from somewhere like Docker official repository or GitHub registry or AWS registry that they have elastic container registry Azure has Azure container registry gcp has GCR or something right so it basically pulls up from different sources depending on how Dy team has configured it you know in the back end so it's going to pull all of these information and we have to wait for it so let me pause the video and come back once this is done all right now you can see we have you know basically downloaded everything over here so if you see Let Me Go a bit up and you can find out all the containers are now running it says running 11 out of 11 created and running attaching to API 1 d B1 engine X One radi one sandbox one ssrf proxy we database web 1 worker one right now you can build anything you want I'm going to talk about it in a bit but if you look at here all the logs every processes that has been started database is ready you know your everything that you need to basically do it and you just have to do Local Host and apps I already have an account administrative account you know with my personal Gmail address if you're coming into your the first time you need to basically create an administrative account or an admin account to deal with DIY now this is how the interface looks like right you have on top explore Studio knowledge tools here we have something called create from blank create from template and import DSL file now imput import DSL file is nothing but for example if you build a workflow if you build an app on D then you can also save that as a file that's called DSL file and you can later share that with your friends or colleagues and they can use the same basically they don't have to reinvent the wheel they can just you know import that file and execute it right now what I'm going to show you here is here we can have something called settings in the settings you have something called Model provider now in the model provider you can set up your llms so if you want to go with close Source thingy you can go with close Source like like for example open AI anthropic Azure you have to basically give an API key and you can find out we have something called o Lama and we are interested in O Lama because we want to self for it and you can see o Lama is running over here right it says o Lama is running on this particular Port right so what I'm going to do I'm going to bring up o Lama so add a model so let's click on o Lama add model now when you see see this so two things you can do you can either you know add an llm or you can add an text embedding model like nomik that ama supports now in the model name you have to be a bit careful and attentive over here otherwise you get a lot of Errors you know sometimes right so here I have taken a note and I'll just show you okay and you should be a bit careful about only these two things and I'm going to talk about it why are important now in base URL these EVS are nothing but your uh where you are running the O Lama but if you just do HTTP Local Host 11434 it will not work because right now you are hosting it through Docker internals if you look at these how we are running it we running it through Docker right we are not running it in some other ways right so you have to use host. Docker do internal and then the port as a base URL don't do HTTP Local Host 11434 it might not connect it's it will give you some error right and model name you have to be again careful because model name should be the same name that o Lama shows you so for example if you come here and I'm going to show you o Lama list that I already have now if you want to bring up Lama 3.2 3B let me just copy this thingy here okay you have to use the same name okay make sure you using the same name okay as the model name you are not using any like other name names over here other that's what I have seen it otherwise it gives error and then you keep this chat chat is fine this model text is fine upper bound of for Max token these are all fine it's not a Vision support it's a Vision support model of course but I'm going to say no for now okay uh and then be a bit very be a bit attentive over here otherwise this is the thing if you pass this step you know you'll be able to work with it otherwise if you are getting some error then you have to also you can also look at how to integrate with o Lama so if you look at this documentation you can also find out how to do it right now come back and let's save it now once you save it okay you can see modified successfully it here says modified successfully you know on top and now if you come come on top you can see a model so you can see you know if you click on so models we have Lama 3.2 3B llm chat 4K so this is a model now that's showing right and you can see the model is active you can also do some configuration you can add other models as well let me just you know cut this off right now let's click on create from blank once you click on create from blank you can find out different options chatbot text generator agent workflow and if you you know if you look at text generat it says build an application that generates high quality text based on prompt such as generating articles summaries translations and more I'll just give a name here called demo app okay and here going write demo of D5 + oama and I'm just going to click on create now once you click on create right you can see here we have you know and let me just remove this thingy by the way okay if you look at this what you have to do Studio demo app we have here something called left hand side orchestrate API access locks and monitoring now here we can see the model if you look at the model it says Lama 3.2 now if you want to add other model you know you can just go the same way you know over here and you can add it sometimes it might take a bit of time guys you know it takes few seconds because then it has to load it from o Lama right so you should wait for it uh once it's load then you can select that model so you can see it over here Lama uh 3.2 and we can find out the model over here right see Lama 3.2 3B that's the model we have loaded from o Lama now I'm going to ask and here you have prefix prompt you can set some prompt as well over here and you can do bit of prompt engineering blah blah blah you can make the query as an optional parameter I'm going to say what is AI or something okay and then run it says output your speed hanging a but can see work with it but I think this also it is you know if it comes to number of characters it has given you 2,000 plus characters so far you over here you can add annotations edit it and what you can also do you can also publish this app so when you say you know when when you click on publish let me just do an update first published and when you click on run app it opens a new uh uh here demo app you know you can say generate ass sort blog post on deep learning or something like that right and we're going to say execute and you can find go back now and that's that you have to do it in knowledge so if you go on knowledge and over here in the knowledge you can create a knowledge base you can see input from file sync you know you can take a document so for example if you have to take a document you can take a document from here you know let's take uh what document we can take guys gastro no I would have some documents let me see I'll just show you how easy it is to basically work with it right now you come here and then you have to bring up an embedding model but I'll just show you how you can bring a document and those kind of things right so I'm going to use a PDF file over here you can see the PDF I'm going to do next and then you can see the preview automatic set chunk and pre-process you can also customize the chunk size you can see maximum chunk length I'm going to do it th000 and then chunk overlap I'm going to keep it 250 okay and confirm and preview uh I don't know what's wrong but okay let me just do a reset there's something wrong I'm going keep automatic okay it didn't work out then you have index mode high quality you have to pay for it you need to set up a API key you know blah blah let's keep it default go to document you can see this is our document so we have like we have a kind of knowledge Bas you can also test the retrieval please enter text uh list all symptoms or something like that right and when you click on testing it basically gives you something if if that's there it might take a bit of time guys but this is how you can create knowledge basis as well and if you go to Studio okay on let me go to settings once permissions economical blah blah blah trial testing again you have to do it the session is not there okay fine now in in studio come back so this you already see it and this is how you can also embed into your site so basically it gives you a code to embed so basically it gives an if frame that you can use it in an HTML code and you can just basically you know do it you can see install D chatbot Chrome extension chatbot URL and you can see how easy it is to basically install you know chatbot Chrome extension as well right that's that's fantastic over here and uh let me do one thing so this is how you can run applications J applications using Dy and AMA knowledge you see how you have knowledge base now if you go to exp let me go to Studio create from blank if you have a chat B right uh you can just give a name called chatboard demo or something you know uh enter the BL blah blah I'm going say create okay instruction and you can see you can give a context now here in the context you know you can add this as a knowledge base right you can see the knowledge base has been added you have citations and attributes you can add you can bring conversational REM markers like a followup questions you can conversation remaker I mean default questions by the way excuse me you can have a follow-up questions as well you can ask follow-up questions and this all looks nice right now you know here you can uh ask some questions blah blah blah and you can see the model over here and you can select model Lama 3.2 chat and here you can write your prompt words here you know variable whatever right you can say you need to answer the user questions from the you need to ask the user questions from the from the given context and something like that okay and you can add variables as much as as you are as as you want right and then you can just you know publish update publish blah blah blah you can see it success right so this is how it is guys fill the value in variable which will automatically replaced right and you can here ask uh uh yeah sort text right and make it optional as well so this is how you can basically build it uh you can also build rag pipeline or you can run the app see it over here start chat blah blah right now it will not work as expected I'll show you slow guys not passing the context credential is not ah okay I got it so it's not we have to pass that P ke is not taking it but yeah at least you got a bit of idea how you can do it right so you can basically watch my previous videos on how to set up these API keys and I want to keep it a very short maybe we can have a separate video for rag chatbot but so far you would have understood how you can set up D5 with AMA how you can configure you can configure it from here by the way just settings model provider and you can you can also add a new model for example if you want to add a new text embeding model like nomic you can do it over here and then just save it right so you can also use it for rag chatbot that's all for this video guys I hope you liked it if you have any question thoughts or feedbacks let me know in the comment box you can also reach out to me through my social media channels if you

      "[\"hello everyone welcome to AI anytime channel in this video we are going to see how we can use a no code platform called def aai with ol Lama earlier I have a video where I've shown how you can use Dy AI you know and geni Innovation engine a completely you know a low code no code platform where you can build jna applications faster and in that video I have shown with close Source models where you need an API key now for example if you want to use models like gp40 om mini you know Cloud models Gemini models Gro models so on and so forth so you need an API key over there to use that but you know most of the time you would not use these apis you want to use something which is open source where you can self host it you know where you can control everything you know mainly from a data confidentiality standpoint right because your data is confidential and you would not like to send that data to a third party company for example here the llm providers so how we can use o Lama a tool that basically helps you inference or run large language models locally in your machine you will be follow you'll be able to follow this video even on a 8GB CPU machine as well okay so we're going to set up Dy and we're going to also use AMA uh any of the new models like Lama 3.2 3B model okay and we're going to use it and see if we are able to set this up and ask some queries or do some task for us so let's jump in and see how we can do that if you look at here on my screen I am on AMA website if you don't know AMA as I said get up and running with llms that's what they have written over here on the website and you can just download I know it's like pretty easy to work with Okay you can download this on any one of the operating system so if you are on Mac OS if you are on Linux of you are on Windows you'll be able to use that okay now I am already on Windows and I have already installed it so I'm not going to do it again but if you are here click on this and just double click and install how can you find out if o Lama is running you see this icon over here it says o Lama right o Lama is running okay now if you want to find out a bit more let me open my terminal okay so if you look at here I'm opening my terminal and you can use command like o Lama list to find out if there are any models available you can see I have lot of models available Lama 3.2 3B Elijah which is a Japanese model it be nomic embedding I have an embedding model Lama 3.1 53 and Lama 3 I have these models that I mainly work with in day-to-day life you know for different tasks that I execute through these llms now how you can use this you have to for example you just have to write o Lama and then run and the model name if you want to download a model you have to do o Lama pull and the model name okay so you use P command to do that now here I'm I going to show you for example Lama 3.2 and 3B and after a few seconds you know it will show you where you can it will say send a message so basically you can ask your query so for example you want to write what is AI or let me say tell me a joke tell me a joke right I say tell me a joke it says here is one what do you call a fake noodle an impasta okay so you can see basically you can just ask a lot of questions over here right now AMA is also available through apis you know you can use uh Local Host and it's available on 11434 you can see it says AMA is running so you can use AMA through Lang chain Lama index or even in basic python through request module if you want to do that you know it's available on Port 11434 right 11,434 that's the port it runs on right now that's on AMA let me cover a bit about dii I have couple of videos on defi already on my channel Innovation engine for engine for Gen applications it's an open source development platform that's why I like about it if you look at other platforms like gum Loof for example or make they are making money for example they are not open source okay so uh nothing against them by the way but I love open source right so uh defy and flow wise flow wise also is very good okay you can use that open source you can basically use uh note to basically install that and build build Solutions on top of it and deploy it but not not the case with gum Loop and make.com or any other platform so defi is one of my Preferred Choice I recommend you use Defi and also flow wise if needed so uh you can see it over here if you click on GitHub it takes you to the GitHub page you know over here it says defi is and open source llm app development platform intuitive interface you can you can basically use dii to build rag pipelines AI agent workflows automation so on and so forth right now Dy you can also you know let me show you how you can bring it up here so if you just have to do get clone and you can see I already have cloned it but anyway I'll just show you once let me show you once so if we're going to write github.com Lang genius I know Dody dogit when I do this it will say this already exist so I already have cloned this repository so if it already exist let's just do CD inside it right so that's what I'm going to do here so I'm going to say you know defy and Docker and I'm just going to open this in vs code so let me just open this in V vs code now if you look at this this is how the doer compos file looks like okay off off this is how the folder looks like when you bring up Dy make sure I miss one this step but I'll show you once you cling it for the first time you will find out something called env. example as GitHub does not it's not a good practice I will not say GitHub does not support pushing EnV files it does it but then the best practice is to do like env. example or through conf Pi or whatever and then replace that when you are working locally or when you are deploying it somewhere in a secret manager or a credentials manager but what you have to do it over here you have to do CP CP means that you want to copy that right the same file to an different file name so you can see I have done cp. env. example and then EnV and that's why these and that's why this is available over here you can see EnV so if you click on EnV you can find out all the EnV thingy and you can whatever if you want to do it here you can bring up so for example if you want to use uh we8 and you can see it over here you can make changes for V8 chroma is here Oracle is here you know engine X is here and you have lot of things over here to be honest you know you have open search uh blah blah blah okay so if you want to work with any service you can select I more interested in Docker compose if you don't know Docker Docker is a container technology I have a lot of videos on Docker I'll recommend you watch that basically you know makes your life easier when you are developing software when you use Docker like a container technology you know it basically eliminate the dependencies conflict from your software development life cycle and there a lot of other benefits by the way okay now this is what we are using as a Docker compose file now what you have to do guys you know here come here you know in in that and then you just have to do dock a compose or you can just up and when you do hyund d hyund d means that it going to run that in a detach mode so in background right so it will not block your terminal for other work and if you do that it's going to take a bit of time you can see it says if you're running it for the first time it's going to take a lot of time because it has to pull a lot of images you know from somewhere like Docker official repository or GitHub registry or AWS registry that they have elastic container registry Azure has Azure container registry gcp has GCR or something right so it basically pulls up from different sources depending on how Dy team has configured it you know in the back end so it's going to pull all of these information and we have to wait for it so let me pause the video and come back once this is done all right now you can see we have you know basically downloaded everything over here so if you see Let Me Go a bit up and you can find out all the containers are now running it says running 11 out of 11 created and running attaching to API 1 d B1 engine X One radi one sandbox one ssrf proxy we database web 1 worker one right now you can build anything you want I'm going to talk about it in a bit but if you look at here all the logs every processes that has been started database is ready you know your everything that you need to basically do it and you just have to do Local Host and apps I already have an account administrative account you know with my personal Gmail address if you're coming into your the first time you need to basically create an administrative account or an admin account to deal with DIY now this is how the interface looks like right you have on top explore Studio knowledge tools here we have something called create from blank create from template and import DSL file now imput import DSL file is nothing but for example if you build a workflow if you build an app on D then you can also save that as a file that's called DSL file and you can later share that with your friends or colleagues and they can use the same basically they don't have to reinvent the wheel they can just you know import that file and execute it right now what I'm going to show you here is here we can have something called settings in the settings you have something called Model provider now in the model provider you can set up your llms so if you want to go with close Source thingy you can go with close Source like like for example open AI anthropic Azure you have to basically give an API key and you can find out we have something called o Lama and we are interested in O Lama because we want to self for it and you can see o Lama is running over here right it says o Lama is running on this particular Port right so what I'm going to do I'm going to bring up o Lama so add a model so let's click on o Lama add model now when you see see this so two things you can do you can either you know add an llm or you can add an text embedding model like nomik that ama supports now in the model name you have to be a bit careful and attentive over here otherwise you get a lot of Errors you know sometimes right so here I have taken a note and I'll just show you okay and you should be a bit careful about only these two things and I'm going to talk about it why are important now in base URL these EVS are nothing but your uh where you are running the O Lama but if you just do HTTP Local Host 11434 it will not work because right now you are hosting it through Docker internals if you look at these how we are running it we running it through Docker right we are not running it in some other ways right so you have to use host. Docker do internal and then the port as a base URL don't do HTTP Local Host 11434 it might not connect it's it will give you some error right and model name you have to be again careful because model name should be the same name that o Lama shows you so for example if you come here and I'm going to show you o Lama list that I already have now if you want to bring up Lama 3.2 3B let me just copy this thingy here okay you have to use the same name okay make sure you using the same name okay as the model name you are not using any like other name names over here other that's what I have seen it otherwise it gives error and then you keep this chat chat is fine this model text is fine upper bound of for Max token these are all fine it's not a Vision support it's a Vision support model of course but I'm going to say no for now okay uh and then be a bit very be a bit attentive over here otherwise this is the thing if you pass this step you know you'll be able to work with it otherwise if you are getting some error then you have to also you can also look at how to integrate with o Lama so if you look at this documentation you can also find out how to do it right now come back and let's save it now once you save it okay you can see modified successfully it here says modified successfully you know on top and now if you come come on top you can see a model so you can see you know if you click on so models we have Lama 3.2 3B llm chat 4K so this is a model now that's showing right and you can see the model is active you can also do some configuration you can add other models as well let me just you know cut this off right now let's click on create from blank once you click on create from blank you can find out different options chatbot text generator agent workflow and if you you know if you look at text generat it says build an application that generates high quality text based on prompt such as generating articles summaries translations and more I'll just give a name here called demo app okay and here going write demo of D5 + oama and I'm just going to click on create now once you click on create right you can see here we have you know and let me just remove this thingy by the way okay if you look at this what you have to do Studio demo app we have here something called left hand side orchestrate API access locks and monitoring now here we can see the model if you look at the model it says Lama 3.2 now if you want to add other model you know you can just go the same way you know over here and you can add it sometimes it might take a bit of time guys you know it takes few seconds because then it has to load it from o Lama right so you should wait for it uh once it's load then you can select that model so you can see it over here Lama uh 3.2 and we can find out the model over here right see Lama 3.2 3B that's the model we have loaded from o Lama now I'm going to ask and here you have prefix prompt you can set some prompt as well over here and you can do bit of prompt engineering blah blah blah you can make the query as an optional parameter I'm going to say what is AI or something okay and then run it says output your speed hanging a but can see work with it but I think this also it is you know if it comes to number of characters it has given you 2,000 plus characters so far you over here you can add annotations edit it and what you can also do you can also publish this app so when you say you know when when you click on publish let me just do an update first published and when you click on run app it opens a new uh uh here demo app you know you can say generate ass sort blog post on deep learning or something like that right and we're going to say execute and you can find go back now and that's that you have to do it in knowledge so if you go on knowledge and over here in the knowledge you can create a knowledge base you can see input from file sync you know you can take a document so for example if you have to take a document you can take a document from here you know let's take uh what document we can take guys gastro no I would have some documents let me see I'll just show you how easy it is to basically work with it right now you come here and then you have to bring up an embedding model but I'll just show you how you can bring a document and those kind of things right so I'm going to use a PDF file over here you can see the PDF I'm going to do next and then you can see the preview automatic set chunk and pre-process you can also customize the chunk size you can see maximum chunk length I'm going to do it th000 and then chunk overlap I'm going to keep it 250 okay and confirm and preview uh I don't know what's wrong but okay let me just do a reset there's something wrong I'm going keep automatic okay it didn't work out then you have index mode high quality you have to pay for it you need to set up a API key you know blah blah let's keep it default go to document you can see this is our document so we have like we have a kind of knowledge Bas you can also test the retrieval please enter text uh list all symptoms or something like that right and when you click on testing it basically gives you something if if that's there it might take a bit of time guys but this is how you can create knowledge basis as well and if you go to Studio okay on let me go to settings once permissions economical blah blah blah trial testing again you have to do it the session is not there okay fine now in in studio come back so this you already see it and this is how you can also embed into your site so basically it gives you a code to embed so basically it gives an if frame that you can use it in an HTML code and you can just basically you know do it you can see install D chatbot Chrome extension chatbot URL and you can see how easy it is to basically install you know chatbot Chrome extension as well right that's that's fantastic over here and uh let me do one thing so this is how you can run applications J applications using Dy and AMA knowledge you see how you have knowledge base now if you go to exp let me go to Studio create from blank if you have a chat B right uh you can just give a name called chatboard demo or something you know uh enter the BL blah blah I'm going say create okay instruction and you can see you can give a context now here in the context you know you can add this as a knowledge base right you can see the knowledge base has been added you have citations and attributes you can add you can bring conversational REM markers like a followup questions you can conversation remaker I mean default questions by the way excuse me you can have a follow-up questions as well you can ask follow-up questions and this all looks nice right now you know here you can uh ask some questions blah blah blah and you can see the model over here and you can select model Lama 3.2 chat and here you can write your prompt words here you know variable whatever right you can say you need to answer the user questions from the you need to ask the user questions from the from the given context and something like that okay and you can add variables as much as as you are as as you want right and then you can just you know publish update publish blah blah blah you can see it success right so this is how it is guys fill the value in variable which will automatically replaced right and you can here ask uh uh yeah sort text right and make it optional as well so this is how you can basically build it uh you can also build rag pipeline or you can run the app see it over here start chat blah blah right now it will not work as expected I'll show you slow guys not passing the context credential is not ah okay I got it so it's not we have to pass that P ke is not taking it but yeah at least you got a bit of idea how you can do it right so you can basically watch my previous videos on how to set up these API keys and I want to keep it a very short maybe we can have a separate video for rag chatbot but so far you would have understood how you can set up D5 with AMA how you can configure you can configure it from here by the way just settings model provider

over here so if you see Let Me Go a bit up and you can find out all the containers are now running it says running 11 out of 11 created and running attaching to API 1 d B1 engine X One radi one sandbox one ssrf proxy we database web 1 worker one right now you can build anything you want I\\'m going to talk about it in a bit but if you look at here all the logs every processes that has been started database is ready you know your everything that you need to basically do it and you just have to do Local Host and apps I already have an account administrative account you know with my personal Gmail address if you\\'re coming into your the first time you need to basically create an administrative account or an admin account to deal with DIY now this is how the interface looks like right you have on top explore Studio knowledge tools here we have something called create from blank create from template and import DSL file now imput import DSL file is nothing but for example if

the settings you have something called Model provider now in the model provider you can set up your llms so if you want to go with close Source thingy you can go with close Source like like for example open AI anthropic Azure you have to basically give an API key and you can find out we have something called o Lama and we are interested in O Lama because we want to self for it and you can see o Lama is running over here right it says o Lama is running on this particular Port right so what I\\'m going to do I\\'m going to bring up o Lama so add a model so let\\'s click on o Lama add model now when you see see this so two things you can do you can either you know add an llm or you can add an text embedding model like nomik that ama supports now in the model name you have to be a bit careful and attentive over here otherwise you get a lot of Errors you know sometimes right so here I have taken a note and I\\'ll just show you okay and you should be a bit careful about only these two things and I\\'m going to talk about it why are important now in base URL these EVS are nothing but your uh where you are running the O Lama but if you just do HTTP Local Host 11434 it will

seen it otherwise it gives error and then you keep this chat chat is fine this model text is fine upper bound of for Max token these are all fine it\\'s not a Vision support it\\'s a Vision support model of course but I\\'m going to say no for now okay uh and then be a bit very be a bit attentive over here otherwise this is the thing if you pass this step you know you\\'ll be able to work with it otherwise if you are getting some error then you have to also you can also look at how to integrate with o Lama so if you look at this documentation you can also find out how to do it right now come back and let\\'s save it now once you save it okay you can see modified successfully it here says modified successfully you know on top and now if you come come on top you can see a model so you can see you know if you click on so models we have Lama 3.2 3B llm chat 4K so this is a model now that\\'s showing right and you can see the model is active you can also do some configuration you can add other models as well let me just you know cut this off right now let\\'s click on create from blank once you click on create from blank you can find out different options chatbot text generator agent workflow and if you you know if you look at text generat it says build an application that generates high quality text based on prompt such as generating articles summaries translations and more I\\'ll just give a name here called demo app okay and here going write demo of D5 + oama and I\\'m just going to click on create now once you click on create right you can see here we have you know and let me just remove this thingy by the way okay if you look at this what you have to do Studio demo app we have here something called left hand side orchestrate API access locks and monitoring now here we can see the model if you look at the model it says Lama 3.2 now if you want to add other model you know you can just go the same way you know over here and you can add it sometimes it might take a bit of time guys you know it takes few seconds because then it has to load it from o Lama right so you should wait for it uh once it\\'s load then you can select that model so you can see it over here Lama uh 3.2 and we can find out the model over here right see Lama 3.2 3B that\\'s the model we have loaded from o Lama now I\\'m going to ask and here you have prefix prompt you can set some prompt as well over here and you can do bit of prompt engineering blah blah blah you can make the query as an optional parameter I\\'m going to say what is AI or something okay and then run it says output your speed hanging a but can see work with it but I think this also it is you know if it comes to number of characters it has given you 2,000 plus characters so far you over here you can add annotations edit it and what you can also do you can also publish this app so when you say you know when when you click on publish let me just do an update first published and when you click on run app it opens a new uh uh here demo app you know you can say generate ass sort blog post on deep learning or something like that right and we\\'re going to say execute and you can find go back now and that\\'s that you have to do it in knowledge so if you go on knowledge and over here in the knowledge you can create a knowledge base you can see input from file sync you know you can take a document so for example if you have to take a document you can take a document from here you know let\\'s take uh what document we can take guys gastro no I would have some documents let me see I\\'ll just show you how easy it is to basically work with it right now you come here and then you have to bring up an embedding model but I\\'ll just show you how you can bring a document and those kind of things right so I\\'m going to use a PDF file over here you can see the PDF I\\'m going to do next and then you can see the preview automatic set chunk and pre-process you can also customize the chunk size you can see maximum chunk length I\\'m going to do it th000 and then chunk overlap I\\'m going to keep it 250 okay and confirm and preview uh I don\\'t know what\\'s wrong but okay let me just do a reset there\\'s something wrong I\\'m going keep automatic okay it didn\\'t work out then you have index mode high quality you have to pay for it you need to set up a API key you know blah blah let\\'s keep it default go to document you can see this is our document so we have like we have a kind of knowledge Bas you can also test the retrieval please enter text uh list all symptoms or something like that right and when you click on testing it basically gives you something if if that\\'s there it might take a bit of time guys but this is how you can create knowledge basis as well and if you go to Studio okay on let me go to settings once permissions economical blah blah blah trial testing again you have to do it the session is not there okay fine now in in studio come back so this you already see it and this is how you can also embed into your site so basically it gives you a code to embed so basically it gives an if frame that you can use it in an HTML code and you can just basically you know do it you can see install D chatbot Chrome extension chatbot URL and you can see how easy it is to basically install you know chatbot Chrome extension as well right that\\'s that\\'s fantastic over here and uh let me do one thing so this is how you can run applications J applications using Dy and AMA knowledge you see how you have knowledge base now if you go to exp let me go to Studio create from blank if you have a chat B right uh you can just give a name called chatboard demo or something you know uh enter the BL blah blah I\\'m going say create okay instruction and you can see you can give a context now here in the context you know you can add this as a knowledge base right you can see the knowledge base has been added you have citations and attributes you can add you can bring conversational REM markers like a followup questions you can conversation remaker I mean default questions by the way excuse me you can have a follow-up questions as well you can ask follow-up questions and this all looks nice right now you know here you can uh ask some questions blah blah blah and you can see the model over here and you can select model Lama 3.2 chat and here you can write your prompt words here you know variable whatever right you can say you need to answer the user questions from the you need to ask the user questions from the from the given context and something like that okay and you can add variables as much as as you are as you want right and then you can just you know publish update publish blah blah blah you can see it success right so this is how it is guys fill the value in variable which will automatically replaced right and you can here ask uh uh yeah sort text right and make it optional as well so this is how you can basically build it uh you can also build rag pipeline or you can run the app see it over here start chat blah blah right now it will not work as expected I\\'ll show you slow guys not passing the context credential is not ah okay I got it so it\\'s not we have to pass that P ke is not taking it but yeah at least you got a bit of idea how you can do it right so you can basically watch my previous videos on how to set up these API keys and I want to keep it a very short maybe we can have a separate video for rag chatbot but so far you would have understood how you can set up D5 with AMA how you can configure you can configure it from here by the way just settings model provider and you can you can also add a new model for example if you want to add a new text embeding model like nomic you can do it over here and then just save it right so you can also use it for rag chatbot that\\'s all for this video guys I hope you liked it if you have any question thoughts or feedbacks you can let me know in the comment box you can also reach out to me through my social media channels if you like the content please hit the like icon if you haven\\'t subscribed the channel yet please do subscribe the channel

       "[\"hello everyone welcome to AI anytime channel in this video we are going to see how we can use a no code platform called def aai with ol Lama earlier I have a video where I've shown how you can use Dy AI you know and geni Innovation engine a completely you know a low code no code platform where you can build jna applications faster and in that video I have shown with close Source models where you need an API key now for example if you want to use models like gp40 om mini you know Cloud models Gemini models Gro models so on and so forth so you need an API key over there to use that but you know most of the time you would not use these apis you want to use something which is open source where you can self host it you know where you can control everything you know mainly from a data confidentiality standpoint right because your data is confidential and you would not like to send that data to a third party company for example here the llm providers so how we can use o Lama a tool that basically helps you inference or run large language models locally in your machine you will be follow you'll be able to follow this video even on a 8GB CPU machine as well okay so we're going to set up Dy and we're going to also use AMA uh any of the new models like Lama 3.2 3B model okay and we're going to use it and see if we are able to set this up and ask some queries or do some task for us so let's jump in and see how we can do that if you look at here on my screen I am on AMA website if you don't know AMA as I said get up and running with llms that's what they have written over here on the website and you can just download I know it's like pretty easy to work with Okay you can download this on any one of the operating system so if you are on Mac OS if you are on Linux of you are on Windows you'll be able to use that okay now I am already on Windows and I have already installed it so I'm not going to do it again but if you are here click on this and just double click and install how can you find out if o Lama is running you see this icon over here it says o Lama right o Lama is running okay now if you want to find out a bit more let me open my terminal okay so if you look at here I'm opening my terminal and you can use command like o Lama list to find out if there are any models available you can see I have lot of models available Lama 3.2 3B Elijah which is a Japanese model it be nomic embedding I have an embedding model Lama 3.1 53 and Lama 3 I have these models that I mainly work with in day-to-day life you know for different tasks that I execute through these llms now how you can use this you have to for example you just have to write o Lama and then run and the model name if you want to download a model you have to do o Lama pull and the model name okay so you use P command to do that now here I'm I going to show you for example Lama 3.2 and 3B and after a few seconds you know it will show you where you can it will say send a message so basically you can ask your query so for example you want to write what is AI or let me say tell me a joke tell me a joke right I say tell me a joke it says here is one what do you call a fake noodle an impasta okay so you can see basically you can just ask a lot of questions over here right now AMA is also available through apis you know you can use uh Local Host and it's available on 11434 you can see it says AMA is running so you can use AMA through Lang chain Lama index or even in basic python through request module if you want to do that you know it's available on Port 11434 right 11,434 that's the port it runs on right now that's on AMA let me cover a bit about dii I have couple of videos on defi already on my channel Innovation engine for engine for Gen applications it's an open source development platform that's why I like about it if you look at other platforms like gum Loof for example or make they are making money for example they are not open source okay so uh nothing against them by the way but I love open source right so uh defy and flow wise flow wise also is very good okay you can use that open source you can basically use uh note to basically install that and build build Solutions on top of it and deploy it but not not the case with gum Loop and make.com or any other platform so defi is one of my Preferred Choice I recommend you use Defi and also flow wise if needed so uh you can see it over here if you click on GitHub it takes you to the GitHub page you know over here it says defi is and open source llm app development platform intuitive interface you can you can basically use dii to build rag pipelines AI agent workflows automation so on and so forth right now Dy you can also you know let me show you how you can bring it up here so if you just have to do get clone and you can see I already have cloned it but anyway I'll just show you once let me show you once so if we're going to write github.com Lang genius I know Dody dogit when I do this it will say this already exist so I already have cloned this repository so if it already exist let's just do CD inside it right so that's what I'm going to do here so I'm going to say you know defy and Docker and I'm just going to open this in vs code so let me just open this in V vs code now if you look at this this is how the doer compos file looks like okay off off this is how the folder looks like when you bring up Dy make sure I miss one this step but I'll show you once you cling it for the first time you will find out something called env. example as GitHub does not it's not a good practice I will not say GitHub does not support pushing EnV files it does it but then the best practice is to do like env. example or through conf Pi or whatever and then replace that when you are working locally or when you are deploying it somewhere in a secret manager or a credentials manager but what you have to do it over here you have to do CP CP means that you want to copy that right the same file to an different file name so you can see I have done cp. env. example and then EnV and that's why these and that's why this is available over here you can see EnV so if you click on EnV you can find out all the EnV thingy and you can whatever if you want to do it here you can bring up so for example if you want to use uh we8 and you can see it over here you can make changes for V8 chroma is here Oracle is here you know engine X is here and you have lot of things over here to be honest you know you have open search uh blah blah blah okay so if you want to work with any service you can select I more interested in Docker compose if you don't know Docker Docker is a container technology I have a lot of videos on Docker I'll recommend you watch that basically you know makes your life easier when you are developing software when you use Docker like a container technology you know it basically eliminate the dependencies conflict from your software development life cycle and there a lot of other benefits by the way okay now this is what we are using as a Docker compose file now what you have to do guys you know here come here you know in in that and then you just have to do dock a compose or you can just up and when you do hyund d hyund d means that it going to run that in a detach mode so in background right so it will not block your terminal for other work and if you do that it's going to take a bit of time you can see it says if you're running it for the first time it's going to take a lot of time because it has to pull a lot of images you know from somewhere like Docker official repository or GitHub registry or AWS registry that they have elastic container registry Azure has Azure container registry gcp has GCR or something right so it basically pulls up from different sources depending on how Dy team has configured it you know in the back end so it's going to pull all of these information and we have to wait for it so let me pause the video and come back once this is done all right now you can see we have you know basically downloaded everything over here so if you see Let Me Go a bit up and you can find out all the containers are now running it says running 11 out of 11 created and running attaching to API 1 d B1 engine X One radi one sandbox one ssrf proxy we database web 1 worker one right now you can build anything you want I'm going to talk about it in a bit but if you look at here all the logs every processes that has been started database is ready you know your everything that you need to basically do it and you just have to do Local Host and apps I already have an account administrative account you know with my personal Gmail address if you're coming into your the first time you need to basically create an administrative account or an admin account to deal with DIY now this is how the interface looks like right you have on top explore Studio knowledge tools here we have something called create from blank create from template and import DSL file now imput import DSL file is nothing but for example if you build a workflow if you build an app on D then you can also save that as a file that's called DSL file and you can later share that with your friends or colleagues and they can use the same basically they don't have to reinvent the wheel they can just you know import that file and execute it right now what I'm going to show you here is here we can have something called settings in the settings you have something called Model provider now in the model provider you can set up your llms so if you want to go with close Source thingy you can go with close Source like like for example open AI anthropic Azure you have to basically give an API key and you can find out we have something called o Lama and we are interested in O Lama because we want to self for it and you can see o Lama is running over here right it says o Lama is running on this particular Port right so what I'm going to do I'm going to bring up o Lama so add a model so let's click on o Lama add model now when you see see this so two things you can do you can either you know add an llm or you can add an text embedding model like nomik that ama supports now in the model name you have to be a bit careful and attentive over here otherwise you get a lot of Errors you know sometimes right so here I have taken a note and I'll just show you okay and you should be a bit careful about only these two things and I'm going to talk about it why are important now in base URL these EVS are nothing but your uh where you are running the O Lama but if you just do HTTP Local Host 11434 it will not work because right now you are hosting it through Docker internals if you look at these how we are running it we running it through Docker right we are not running it in some other ways right so you have to use host. Docker do internal and then the port as a base URL don't do HTTP Local Host 11434 it might not connect it's it will give you some error right and model name you have to be again careful because model name should be the same name that o Lama shows you so for example if you come here and I'm going to show you o Lama list that I already have now if you want to bring up Lama 3.2 3B let me just copy this thingy here okay you have to use the same name okay make sure you using the same name okay as the model name you are not using any like other name names over here other that's what I have seen it otherwise it gives error and then you keep this chat chat is fine this model text is fine upper bound of for Max token these are all fine it's not a Vision support it's a Vision support model of course but I'm going to say no for now okay uh and then be a bit very be a bit attentive over here otherwise this is the thing if you pass this step you know you'll be able to work with it otherwise if you are getting some error then you have to also you can also look at how to integrate with o Lama so if you look at this documentation you can also find out how to do it right now come back and let's save it now once you save it okay you can see modified successfully it here says modified successfully you know on top and now if you come come on top you can see a model so you can see you know if you click on so models we have Lama 3.2 3B llm chat 4K so this is a model now that's showing right and you can see the model is active you can also do some configuration you can add other models as well let me just you know cut this off right now let's click on create from blank once you click on create from blank you can find out different options chatbot text generator agent workflow and if you you know if you look at text generat it says build an application that generates high quality text based on prompt such as generating articles summaries translations and more I'll just give a name here called demo app okay and here going write demo of D5 + oama and I'm just going to click on create now once you click on create right you can see here we have you know and let me just remove this thingy by the way okay if you look at this what you have to do Studio demo app we have here something called left hand side orchestrate API access locks and monitoring now here we can see the model if you look at the model it says Lama 3.2 now if you want to add other model you know you can just go the same way you know over here and you can add it sometimes it might take a bit of time guys you know it takes few seconds because then it has to load it from o Lama right so you should wait for it uh once it's load then you can select that model so you can see it over here Lama uh 3.2 and we can find out the model over here right see Lama 3.2 3B that's the model we have loaded from o Lama now I'm going to ask and here you have prefix prompt you can set some prompt as well over here and you can do bit of prompt engineering blah blah blah you can make the query as an optional parameter I'm going to say what is AI or something okay and then run it says output your speed hanging a but can see work with it but I think this also it is you know if it comes to number of characters it has given you 2,000 plus characters so far you over here you can add annotations edit it and what you can also do you can also publish this app so when you say you know when when you click on publish let me just do an update first published and when you click on run app it opens a new uh uh here demo app you know you can say generate ass sort blog post on deep learning or something like that right and we're going to say execute and you can find go back now and that's that you have to do it in knowledge so if you go on knowledge and over here in the knowledge you can create a knowledge base you can see input from file sync you know you can take a document so for example if you have to take a document you can take a document from here you know let's take uh what document we can take guys gastro no I would have some documents let me see I'll just show you how easy it is to basically work with it right now you come here and then you have to bring up an embedding model but I'll just show you how you can bring a document and those kind of things right so I'm going to use a PDF file over here you can see the PDF I'm going to do next and then you can see the preview automatic set chunk and pre-process you can also customize the chunk size you can see maximum chunk length I'm going to do it th000 and then chunk overlap I'm going to keep it 250 okay and confirm and preview uh I don't know what's wrong but okay let me just do a reset there's something wrong I'm going keep automatic okay it didn't work out then you have index mode high quality you have to pay for it you need to set up a API key you know blah blah let's keep it default go to document you can see this is our document so we have like we have a kind of knowledge Bas you can also test the retrieval please enter text uh list all symptoms or something like that right and when you click on testing it basically gives you something if if that's there it might take a bit of time guys but this is how you can create knowledge basis as well and if you go to Studio okay on let me go to settings once permissions economical blah blah blah trial testing again you have to do it the session is not there okay fine now in in studio come back so this you already see it and this is how you can also embed into your site so basically it gives you a code to embed so basically it gives an if frame that you can use it in an HTML code and you can just basically you know do it you can see install D chatbot Chrome extension chatbot URL and you can see how easy it is to basically install you know chatbot Chrome extension as well right that's that's fantastic over here and uh let me do one thing so this is how you can run applications J applications using Dy and AMA knowledge you see how you have knowledge base now if you go to exp let me go to Studio create from blank if you have a chat B right uh you can just give a name called chatboard demo or something you know uh enter the BL blah blah I'm going say create okay instruction and you can see you can give a context now here in the context you know you can add this as a knowledge base right you can see the knowledge base has been added you have citations and attributes you can add you can bring conversational REM markers like a followup questions you can conversation remaker I mean default questions by the way excuse me you can have a follow-up questions as well you can ask follow-up questions and this all looks nice right now you know here you can uh ask some questions blah blah blah and you can see the model over here and you can select model Lama 3.2 chat and here you can write your prompt words here you know variable whatever right you can say you need to answer the user questions from the you need to ask the user questions from the from the given context and something like that okay and you can add variables as much as as you are as as you want right and then you can just you know publish update publish blah blah blah you can see it success right so this is how it is guys fill the value in variable which will automatically replaced right and you can here ask uh uh yeah sort text right and make it optional as well so this is how you can basically build it uh you can also build rag pipeline or you can run the app see it over here start chat blah blah right now it will not work as expected I'll show you slow guys not passing the context credential is not ah okay I got it so it's not we have to pass that P ke is not

intuitive interface you can you can basically use dii to build rag pipelines AI agent workflows automation so on and so forth right now Dy you can also you know let me show you how you can bring it up

changes for V8 chroma is here Oracle is here you know engine X is here and you have lot of things over here to be honest you know you have open search uh blah blah blah okay so if you want to work with any service you can select I more interested in Docker compose if you don't know Docker Docker is a container technology I have a lot of videos on Docker I'll recommend you watch that basically you know makes your life easier when you are developing software when you use Docker like a container technology you know it basically eliminate the dependencies conflict from your software development life cycle and there a lot of other benefits by the way okay now this is what we are using as a Docker compose file now what you have to do guys you know here come here you know in in that and then you just have to do dock a compose or you can just up and when you do hyund d hyund d means that it going to run that in a detach mode so in background right so it will not block your terminal for other work and if you do that it's going to take a bit of time you can see it says if you're running it for the first time it's going to take a lot of time because it has to pull a lot of images you know from somewhere like Docker official repository or GitHub registry or AWS registry that they have elastic container registry Azure has Azure container registry gcp has GCR or something right so it basically pulls up from different sources depending on how Dy team has configured it you know in the back end so it's going to pull all of these information and we have to wait for it so let me pause the video and come back once this is done all right now you can see we have you know basically downloaded everything over here so if you see Let Me Go a bit up and you can find out all the containers are now running it says running 11 out of 11 created and running attaching to API 1 d B1 engine X One radi one sandbox one ssrf proxy we database web 1 worker one right now you can build anything you want I'm going to talk about it in a bit but if you look at here all the logs every processes that has been started database is ready you know your everything that you need to basically do it and you just have to do Local Host and apps I already have an account administrative account you know with my personal Gmail address if you're coming into your the first time you need to basically create an administrative account or an admin account to deal with DIY now this is how the interface looks like right you have on top explore Studio knowledge tools here we have something called create from blank create from template and import DSL file now imput import DSL file is nothing but for example if you build a workflow if you build an app on D then you can also save that as a file that's called DSL file and you can later share that with your friends or colleagues and they can use the same basically they don't have to reinvent the wheel they can just you know import that file and execute it right now what I'm going to show you here is here we can have something called settings in the settings you have something called Model provider now in the model provider you can set up your llms so if you want to go with close Source thingy you can go with close Source like like for example open AI anthropic Azure you have to basically give an API key and you can find out we have something called o Lama and we are interested in O Lama because we want to self for it and you can see o Lama is running over here right it says o Lama is running on this particular Port right so what I'm going to do I'm going to bring up o Lama so add a model so let's click on o Lama add model now when you see see this so two things you can do you can either you know add an llm or you can add an text embedding model like nomik that ama supports now in the model name you have to be a bit careful and attentive over here otherwise you get a lot of Errors you know sometimes right so here I have taken a note and I'll just show you okay and you should be a bit careful about only these two things and I'm going to talk about it why are important now in base URL these EVS are nothing but your uh where you are running the O Lama but if you just do HTTP Local Host 11434 it will not work because right now you are hosting it through Docker internals if you look at these how we are running it we running it through Docker right we are not running it in some other ways right so you have to use host. Docker do internal and then the port as a base URL don't do HTTP Local Host 11434 it might not connect it's it will give you some error right and model name you have to be again careful because model name should be the same name that o Lama shows you so for example if you come here and I'm going to show you o Lama list that I already have now if you want to bring up Lama 3.2 3B let me just copy this thingy here okay you have to use the same name okay make sure you using the same name okay as the model name you are not using any like other name names over here other that's what I have seen it otherwise it gives error and then you keep this chat chat is fine this model text is fine upper bound of for Max token these are all fine it's not a Vision support it's a Vision support model of course but I'm going to say no for now okay uh and then be a bit very be a bit attentive over here otherwise this is the thing if you pass this step you know you'll be able to work with it otherwise if you are getting some error then you have to also you can also look at how to integrate with o Lama so if you look at this documentation you can also find out how to do it right now come back and let's save it now once you save it okay you can see modified successfully it here says modified successfully you know on top and now if you come come on top you can see a model so you can see you know if you click on so models we have Lama 3.2 3B llm chat 4K so this is a model now that's showing right and you can see the model is active you can also do some configuration you can add other models as well let me just you know cut this off right now let's click on create from blank once you click on create from blank you can find out different options chatbot text generator agent workflow and if you you know if you look at text generat it says build an application that generates high quality text based on prompt such as generating articles summaries translations and more I'll just give a name here called demo app okay and here going write demo of D5 + oama and I'm just going to click on create now once you click on create right you can see here we have you know and let me just remove this thingy by the way okay if you look at this what you have to do Studio demo app we have here something called left hand side orchestrate API access locks and monitoring now here we can see the model if you look at the model it says Lama 3.2 now if you want to add other model you know you can just go the same way you know over here and you can add it sometimes it might take a bit of time guys you know it takes few seconds because then it has to load it from o Lama right so you should wait for it uh once it's load then you can select that model so you can see it over here Lama uh 3.2 and we can find out the model over here right see Lama 3.2 3B that's the model we have loaded from o Lama now I'm going to ask and here you have prefix prompt you can set some prompt as well over here and you can do bit of prompt engineering blah blah blah you can make the query as an optional parameter I'm going to say what is AI or something okay and then run it says output your speed hanging a but can see work with it but I think this also it is you know if it comes to number of characters it has given you 2,000 plus characters so far you over here you can add annotations edit it and what you can also do you can also publish this app so when you say you know when when you click on publish let me just do an update first published and when you click on run app it opens a new uh uh here demo app you know you can say generate ass sort blog post on deep learning or something like that right and we're going to say execute and you can find go back now and that's that you have to do it in knowledge so if you go on knowledge and over here in the knowledge you can create a knowledge base you can see input from file sync you know you can take a document so for example if you have to take a document you can take a document from here you know let's take uh what document we can take guys gastro no I would have some documents let me see I'll just show you how easy it is to basically work with it right now you come here and then you have to bring up an embedding model but I'll just show you how you can bring a document and those kind of things right so I'm going to use a PDF file over here you can see the PDF I'm going to do next and then you can see the preview automatic set chunk and pre-process you can also customize the chunk size you can see maximum chunk length I'm going to do it th000 and then chunk overlap I'm going to keep it 250 okay and confirm and preview uh I don't know what's wrong but okay let me just do a reset there's something wrong I'm going keep automatic okay it didn't work out then you have index mode high quality you have to pay for it you need to set up a API key you know blah blah let's keep it default go to document you can see this is our document so we have like we have a kind of knowledge Bas you can also test the retrieval please enter text uh list all symptoms or something like that right and when you click on testing it basically gives you something if if that's there it might take a bit of time guys but this is how you can create knowledge basis as well and if you go to Studio okay on let me go to settings once permissions economical blah blah blah trial testing again you have to do it the session is not there okay fine now in in studio come back so this you already see it and this is how you can also embed into your site so basically it gives you a code to embed so basically it gives an if frame that you can use it in an HTML code and you can just basically you know do it you can see install D chatbot Chrome extension chatbot URL and you can see how easy it is to basically install you know chatbot Chrome extension as well right that's that's fantastic over here and uh let me do one thing so this is how you can run applications J applications using Dy and AMA knowledge you see how you have knowledge base now if you go to exp let me go to Studio create from blank if you have a chat B right uh you can just give a name called chatboard demo or something you know uh enter the BL blah blah I'm going say create okay instruction and you can see you can give a context now here in the context you know you can add this as a knowledge base right you can see the knowledge base has been added you have citations and attributes you can add you can bring conversational REM markers like a followup questions you can conversation remaker I mean default questions by the way excuse me you can have a follow-up questions as well you can ask follow-up questions and this all looks nice right now you know here you can uh ask some questions blah blah blah and you can see the model over here and you can select model Lama 3.2 chat and here you can write your prompt words here you know variable whatever right you can say you need to answer the user questions from the you need to ask the user questions from the from the given context and something like that okay and you can add variables as much as as you are as as you want right and then you can just you know publish update publish blah blah blah you can see it success right so this is how it is guys fill the value in variable which will automatically replaced right and you can here ask uh uh yeah sort text right and make it optional as well so this is how you can basically build it uh you can also build rag pipeline or you can run the app see it over here start chat blah blah right now it will not work as expected I'll show you slow guys not passing the context credential is not ah okay I got it so it's not we have to pass that P ke is not taking it but yeah at least you got a bit of idea how you can do it right so you can basically watch my previous videos on how to set up these API keys and I want to keep it a very short maybe we can have a separate video for rag chatbot but so far you would have understood how you can set up D5 with AMA how you can configure you can configure it from here by the way just settings model provider and you can you can also add a new model for example if you want to add a new text embeding model like nomic you can do it over here and then just save it right so you can also use it for rag chatbot that's all for this video guys I hope you liked it if you have any question thoughts or feedbacks let me know in the comment box you can also reach out to me through my social media channels if you

       "[\"hello everyone welcome to AI anytime channel in this video we are going to see how we can use a no code platform called def aai with ol Lama earlier I have a video where I've shown how you can use Dy AI you know and geni Innovation engine a completely you know a low code no code platform where you can build jna applications faster and in that video I have shown with close Source models where you need an API key now for example if you want to use models like gp40 om mini you know Cloud models Gemini models Gro models so on and so forth so you need an API key over there to use that but you know most of the time you would not use these apis you want to use something which is open source where you can self host it you know where you can control everything you know mainly from a data confidentiality standpoint right because your data is confidential and you would not like to send that data to a third party company for example here the llm providers so how we can use o Lama a tool that basically helps you inference or run large language models locally in your machine you will be follow you'll be able to follow this video even on a 8GB CPU machine as well okay so we're going to set up Dy and we're going to also use AMA uh any of the new models like Lama 3.2 3B model okay and we're going to use it and see if we are able to set this up and ask some queries or do some task for us so let's jump in and see how we can do that if you look at here on my screen I am on AMA website if you don't know AMA as I said get up and running with llms that's what they have written over here on the website and you can just download I know it's like pretty easy to work with Okay you can download this on any one of the operating system so if you are on Mac OS if you are on Linux of you are on Windows you'll be able to use that okay now I am already on Windows and I have already installed it so I'm not going to do it again but if you are here click on this and just double click and install how can you find out if o Lama is running you see this icon over here it says o Lama right o Lama is running okay now if you want to find out a bit more let me open my terminal okay so if you look at here I'm opening my terminal and you can use command like o Lama list to find out if there are any models available you can see I have lot of models available Lama 3.2 3B Elijah which is a Japanese model it be nomic embedding I have an embedding model Lama 3.1 53 and Lama 3 I have these models that I mainly work with in day-to-day life you know for different tasks that I execute through these llms now how you can use this you have to for example you just have to write o Lama and then run and the model name if you want to download a model you have to do o Lama pull and the model name okay so you use P command to do that now here I'm I going to show you for example Lama 3.2 and 3B and after a few seconds you know it will show you where you can it will say send a message so basically you can ask your query so for example you want to write what is AI or let me say tell me a joke tell me a joke right I say tell me a joke it says here is one what do you call a fake noodle an impasta okay so you can see basically you can just ask a lot of questions over here right now AMA is also available through apis you know you can use uh Local Host and it's available on 11434 you can see it says AMA is running so you can use AMA through Lang chain Lama index or even in basic python through request module if you want to do that you know it's available on Port 11434 right 11,434 that's the port it runs on right now that's on AMA let me cover a bit about dii I have couple of videos on defi already on my channel Innovation engine for engine for Gen applications it's an open source development platform that's why I like about it if you look at other platforms like gum Loof for example or make they are making money for example they are not open source okay so uh nothing against them by the way but I love open source right so uh defy and flow wise flow wise also is very good okay you can use that open source you can basically use uh note to basically install that and build build Solutions on top of it and deploy it but not not the case with gum Loop and make.com or any other platform so defi is one of my Preferred Choice I recommend you use Defi and also flow wise if needed so uh you can see it over here if you click on GitHub it takes you to the GitHub page you know over here it says defi is and open source llm app development platform intuitive interface you can you can basically use dii to build rag pipelines AI agent workflows automation so on and so forth right now Dy you can also you know let me show you how you can bring it up here so if you just have to do get clone and you can see I already have cloned it but anyway I'll just show you once let me show you once so if we're going to write github.com Lang genius I know Dody dogit when I do this it will say this already exist so I already have cloned this repository so if it already exist let's just do CD inside it right so that's what I'm going to do here so I'm going to say you know defy and Docker and I'm just going to open this in vs code so let me just open this in V vs code now if you look at this this is how the doer compos file looks like okay off off this is how the folder looks like when you bring up Dy make sure I miss one this step but I'll show you once you cling it for the first time you will find out something called env. example as GitHub does not it's not a good practice I will not say GitHub does not support pushing EnV files it does it but then the best practice is to do like env. example or through conf Pi or whatever and then replace that when you are working locally or when you are deploying it somewhere in a secret manager or a credentials manager but what you have to do it over here you have to do CP CP means that you want to copy that right the same file to an different file name so you can see I have done cp. env. example and then EnV and that's why these and that's why this is available over here you can see EnV so if you click on EnV you can find out all the EnV thingy and you can whatever if you want to do it here you can bring up so for example if you want to use uh we8 and you can see it over here you can make changes for V8 chroma is here Oracle is here you know engine X is here and you have lot of things over here to be honest you know you have open search uh blah blah blah okay so if you want to work with any service you can select I more interested in Docker compose if you don't know Docker Docker is a container technology I have a lot of videos on Docker I'll recommend you watch that basically you know makes your life easier when you are developing software when you use Docker like a container technology you know it basically eliminate the dependencies conflict from your software development life cycle and there a lot of other benefits by the way okay now this is what we are using as a Docker compose file now what you have to do guys you know here come here you know in in that and then you just have to do dock a compose or you can just up and when you do hyund d hyund d means that it going to run that in a detach mode so in background right so it will not block your terminal for other work and if you do that it's going to take a bit of time you can see it says if you're running it for the first time it's going to take a lot of time because it has to pull a lot of images you know from somewhere like Docker official repository or GitHub registry or AWS registry that they have elastic container registry Azure has Azure container registry gcp has GCR or something right so it basically pulls up from different sources depending on how Dy team has configured it you know in the back end so it's going to pull all of these information and we have to wait for it so let me pause the video and come back once this is done all right now you can see we have you know basically downloaded everything over here so if you see Let Me Go a bit up and you can find out all the containers are now running it says running 11 out of 11 created and running attaching to API 1 d B1 engine X One radi one sandbox one ssrf proxy we database web 1 worker one right now you can build anything you want I'm going to talk about it in a bit but if you look at here all the logs every processes that has been started database is ready you know your everything that you need to basically do it and you just have to do Local Host and apps I already have an account administrative account you know with my personal Gmail address if you're coming into your the first time you need to basically create an administrative account or an admin account to deal with DIY now this is how the interface looks like right you have on top explore Studio knowledge tools here we have something called create from blank create from template and import DSL file now imput import DSL file is nothing but for example if you build a workflow if you build an app on D then you can also save that as a file that's called DSL file and you can later share that with your friends or colleagues and they can use the same basically they don't have to reinvent the wheel they can just you know import that file and execute it right now what I'm going to show you here is here we can have something called settings in the settings you have something called Model provider now in the model provider you can

you you know if you look at text generat it says build an application that generates high quality text based on prompt such as generating articles summaries translations and more I'll just give a name here called demo app okay and here going write demo of D5 + oama and I'm just going to click on create now once you click on create right you can see here we have you know and let me just remove this thingy by the way okay if you look at this what you have to do Studio demo app we have here something called left hand side orchestrate API access locks and monitoring now here we can see the model if you look at the model it says Lama 3.2 now if you want to add other model you know you can just go the same way you know over here and you can add it sometimes it might take a bit of time guys you

here you can see the PDF I'm going to do next and then you can see the preview automatic set chunk and pre-process you can also customize the chunk size you can see maximum chunk length I'm going to do it th000 and then chunk overlap I'm going to keep it 250 okay and confirm and preview uh I don't know what's wrong but okay let me just do a reset there's something wrong I'm going keep automatic okay it didn't work out then you have index mode high quality you have to pay for it you need to set up a API key you know blah blah let's keep it default go to document you can see this is our

can add this as a knowledge base right you can see the knowledge base has been added you have citations and attributes you can add you can bring conversational REM markers like a followup questions you can conversation remaker I mean default questions by the way excuse me you can have a follow-up questions as well you can ask follow-up questions and this all looks nice right now you know here you can uh ask some questions blah blah blah and you can see the model over here and you can select model Lama 3.2 chat and here you can write your prompt words here you know variable whatever right
